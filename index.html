    <h1>CRUD Operations Using MongoDB(L&T Project)</h1>
    <p class="description">
      This project focuses on implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
      operations using MongoDB, a NoSQL database known for its scalability and
      flexibility. By leveraging MongoDB's document-oriented storage, the
      project aims to efficiently manage and manipulate data through robust
      CRUD functionalities. The implementation includes connecting to the
      MongoDB server, performing data insertions, retrieving records, updating
      existing entries, and deleting unnecessary data. This project serves as
      a practical demonstration of MongoDB's capabilities in handling dynamic
      and high-volume datasets.
